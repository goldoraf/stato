==== KNOWN BUGS ====

#1 : Unit test case for Stato_Webflow_Forms_FormTest::testIsValidWithVariousConstraints
fail with : 
There was 1 failure: 
Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.
[...]
-    [cc] => xssxssjohn@
+    [cc] => xss/xssjohn@

It's a php behaviour change (or bug fixe I'm not really sure) between php 5.2 
and php 5.3.
Not really important, Stato will just not trim / in the left part of the email
 in php 5.2 (which seems to be normal to me...).

#2 : Stato Orm not migrated :
Yes it's not and will not be.

#3 : Multiple Unit test case fail with : 
file_put_contents(/path/to/stato52/tests/Stato/Cli/Command/../files/locale/en.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
Just do :
host:~# mkdir /path/to/stato52/tests/Stato/Cli/Command/../files/locale/

#3 : Multiple Unit test case fail with : 
file_put_contents(/path/to/stato52/tests/Stato/I18n/Backend/../tmp/klingon.php)
Just do :
host:~# mkdir /path/to/stato52/tests/Stato/I18n/Backend/../tmp/

#4 : The stato.php file is not successfully migrated
Well is not hard to manually migrate it :
replace '\\' by '_' at line 8
replace CommandRunner by Stato_Cli_CommandRunner at line 14
==== TODO ====

# Migrate the documentation

# Fasten the migration script
