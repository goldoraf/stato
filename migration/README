==== How to convert Stato 2.0 from php 5.3 to php 5.2 ====
First create a migration repository :

host:~# mkdir migration

Move the migration script into this directtory

host:~# cp 5.3to5.2.sh migration/

Get the latest stato revision from github :

host:~# cd migration
host:~/migration# git clone git://github.com/goldoraf/stato.git
host:~/migration# ls
5.3to5.2.sh  stato

Then juste execute the shell script (it can be very long, about 20 minutes
 depending on the hardware):

host:~/migration# time sh 5.3to5.2.sh
...
host:~/migration# ls 
5.3to5.2.sh  stato stato52

The stato52 repository should  contain the stato version compatible with 
php 5.2, to be sure go to the test repository and execute the stato unit
test suite :
host:~/migration# cd stato52/tests/Stato
host:~/migration/stato52/tests/Stato# phpunit Stato_AllTests AllTests.php

This is it.
Take a look at the TODO file, to see known bugs and work in progress.
